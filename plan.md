# LangGraph Prebuilts Custom Event Streaming Investigation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the investigation and reproduction of custom event streaming issues with LangGraph prebuilts, specifically:
1. RemoteGraph + supervisor setup with custom event streaming from subagents
2. create_react_agent with custom tool streaming

## Phase 1: Environment Setup and Research

### 1.1 Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create virtual environment and install dependencies
- [ ] Set up basic project structure with proper imports
- [ ] Install LangGraph, LangChain, and related dependencies
- [ ] Configure environment variables for API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### 1.2 Documentation Research
- [ ] Research LangGraph prebuilts streaming capabilities
- [ ] Investigate `stream_writer` usage patterns and limitations
- [ ] Review RemoteGraph documentation for custom event propagation
- [ ] Study create_react_agent streaming behavior
- [ ] Examine pre/post-model hooks for custom event injection

## Phase 2: RemoteGraph + Supervisor Setup

### 2.1 Base Components
- [ ] Create a basic React agent that can be deployed remotely
- [ ] Implement custom tool with stream_writer capabilities
- [ ] Set up LangGraph Studio or deployment environment for remote agents
- [ ] Create supervisor graph using create_supervisor

### 2.2 Custom Event Streaming Implementation
- [ ] Implement stream_writer in remote agent tools
- [ ] Configure supervisor to receive and propagate custom events
- [ ] Test custom event flow from subagent to supervisor
- [ ] Document any blocking issues or limitations

### 2.3 Test Scenarios
- [ ] Single remote agent with custom streaming
- [ ] Multiple remote agents with different custom events
- [ ] Supervisor decision-making based on custom events
- [ ] Error handling when streaming fails

## Phase 3: create_react_agent Direct Implementation

### 3.1 Basic Setup
- [ ] Create simple create_react_agent with custom tools
- [ ] Implement tools that attempt to use stream_writer
- [ ] Test basic streaming functionality

### 3.2 Custom Event Integration Attempts
- [ ] Wrap agent in custom node functions
- [ ] Try pre/post-model hooks for custom event injection
- [ ] Implement custom StateGraph wrapper around react agent
- [ ] Test tool-level custom event streaming

### 3.3 Alternative Approaches
- [ ] Custom tool decorators for streaming
- [ ] Middleware patterns for event injection
- [ ] Direct StateGraph implementation with react-like behavior

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Streaming Behavior Analysis
- [ ] Create test harness for streaming validation
- [ ] Compare streaming output between different approaches
- [ ] Document event propagation timing and order
- [ ] Test with different LLM providers

### 4.2 Performance and Reliability Testing
- [ ] Stress test custom event streaming
- [ ] Test error recovery and graceful degradation
- [ ] Validate streaming consistency across multiple runs
- [ ] Memory usage and performance impact analysis

## Phase 5: Investigation and Debugging

### 5.1 Core Limitations Analysis
- [ ] Identify architectural constraints in prebuilts
- [ ] Document stream_writer scope and limitations
- [ ] Analyze event propagation mechanisms
- [ ] Map out supported vs unsupported streaming patterns

### 5.2 Workaround Development
- [ ] Develop custom middleware solutions
- [ ] Create wrapper patterns for enhanced streaming
- [ ] Implement event forwarding mechanisms
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing prebuilts

## Phase 6: Documentation and Recommendations

### 6.1 Findings Documentation
- [ ] Document working solutions and their limitations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Provide performance benchmarks and best practices
- [ ] Include code examples for each approach

### 6.2 Recommendations
- [ ] Recommend best approach for each use case
- [ ] Suggest feature requests for LangGraph team
- [ ] Provide migration paths for existing implementations
- [ ] Create decision matrix for streaming approach selection

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **RemoteGraph Streaming**: Can custom events from remote subagents reliably stream through the supervisor?
2. **Tool-Level Streaming**: Is there a supported way to emit custom events from tools in create_react_agent?
3. **Hook Integration**: Can pre/post-model hooks be used to inject custom streaming events?
4. **Event Propagation**: How do custom events propagate through different graph structures?
5. **Performance Impact**: What's the overhead of custom event streaming vs standard streaming?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Reproducible setup for both RemoteGraph + supervisor and create_react_agent scenarios
- [ ] Clear documentation of what works, what doesn't, and why
- [ ] Working code examples for supported streaming patterns
- [ ] Identified workarounds for unsupported scenarios
- [ ] Performance and reliability assessment of each approach

## Deliverables

1. **Working Code Examples**
   - RemoteGraph + supervisor with custom streaming
